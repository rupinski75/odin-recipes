    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Boiling water occurs when it reaches a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit) at sea level, causing
    it to transition from a liquid to a gaseous state as steam. This process is commonly used in cooking, sterilization, and
    various scientific applications, as boiling water can effectively kill bacteria and dissolve substances.</p>
