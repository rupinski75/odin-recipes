    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sourdough bread is a type of bread made through the natural fermentation of dough, using wild yeast and lactic acid bacteria from the environment, which gives it a distinctive tangy flavor and chewy texture. Its unique leavening process not only enhances the taste but also improves the bread's digestibility and shelf life compared to commercially yeasted breads.</p>
